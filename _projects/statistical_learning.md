## Overview
**Grade Received**: Distinction (79%)

This piece of work is a Level 7 (MSc) submission to University of Leeds, for a module entitled *Statistical Learning*. The assessment was split into 3 problems with the following briefs:

- *Problem 1: Olympic Medal Counts*
	- Fit a linear regression model for 2012 Olympic Medal Counts based on country population and GDP
	- Analyse model fit and explain if the model is appropriate for the data
	- Comment on whether residuals depend on the magnitude of the output values
	- Consider a combination of log transformations, AIC and cross-validation to deduce a potential optimal model.
- *Problem 2: Brexit Votes*
	- Consider a logistic regression model and explain which model inputs have relevance.
	- Discuss factors that may affect interpretability of the regression coefficients
	- Based on the discussion, explain whether the relevance of inputs can be reliably determined.
- *Problem 3: Heart Disease*
	- Use decision trees and random forests for predicting the output based on all attributes in the data
	- Tune each supervised learning method for maximal predictive performance, using the number of indivduals correectly classified as the criterion
	- Does random forest perform better than a single decision tree?
	- Visualise and interpret the final fitted decision tree model
